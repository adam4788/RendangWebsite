"Build a fully responsive website for a restaurant called 'Rendang and Refresh'. The website must work perfectly on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. It should include the following sections/pages:

Navigation Bar:

Fixed at the top with links to 'Home', 'About', 'Menu', 'Order', 'Events', and 'Contact'.
Use a modern, clean design with a dark background and contrasting text.
Hero Section (Home Page):

A full-width section with an attractive background image (a placeholder image URL is acceptable).
Headline: 'Welcome to Rendang and Refresh'.
Tagline: 'Experience the authentic taste of traditional rendang paired with refreshing beverages.'
A call-to-action button that scrolls to the Menu section.
About Section:

A brief description of the restaurantâ€™s concept, history, and passion for authentic flavors.
Menu Section:

List at least three items (e.g., Classic Beef Rendang, Chicken Rendang, Refreshing Beverages) with short descriptions (and prices if desired).
Use a responsive grid or card layout.
Order Section:

Include an order form with fields for customer name, email, phone number, order details (e.g., item selection, quantity), and special instructions.
On form submission, integrate with Google Sheets (using the Google Sheets API or a similar service) to store the order data in a sheet for easy access.
Display a success message upon successful submission.
Events Page:

Create a dedicated page for upcoming events.
Add a section for the next event with details that 'Rendang and Refresh' will be vendoring at the next Pasar Permias event on April 5th.
Include information such as event date, time, location, and any additional details or a call-to-action (e.g., 'Learn More' or 'Reserve a Spot').
Contact Section:

Include contact details: an email (e.g., info@rendangandrefresh.com), phone number, and physical address.
Footer:

Include copyright information and any other relevant links.
Additional Requirements:

Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (if needed) without external frameworks.
Implement responsive design with proper meta tags and media queries.
Choose a color palette that suits a culinary theme (for example, warm reds, oranges, and neutral tones) and a clean, modern sans-serif font (like Arial or Roboto).
Ensure the code is well-organized into separate files (index.html, styles.css, script.js, and additional pages as needed) with clear comments.
Do not change the overall structure; stick to the detailed requirements above.
Provide clear instructions or code comments where integration with Google Sheets is implemented so that future modifications (such as adding API keys or adjusting the integration) can be handled easily.
